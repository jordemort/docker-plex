# docker-plex

This is the [official Plex container](https://github.com/plexinc/pms-docker), with the addition of the entrypoint from [keylase/nvidia-patch](https://github.com/keylase/nvidia-patch) and the `Plex Transcoder` script from [weshofmann/docker-plex-nvdec](https://github.com/weshofmann/docker-plex-nvdec).

## ARCHIVED

I no longer use this or maintain it. I suggest you try [something like this](https://tizutech.com/plex-transcoding-with-docker-nvidia-gpu/).
